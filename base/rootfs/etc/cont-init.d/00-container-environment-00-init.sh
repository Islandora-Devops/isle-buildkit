# Sets container environment variables in order of precedence depending on the
# source:
#
#  1. Confd backend (highest)
#  2. Secrets kept in /run/secrets
#  3. Environment variables passed into the container
#  4. Environment variables defined in Dockerfile(s)
#  5. Environment variables defined in the /etc/defaults directory (lowest only used for multiline variables)
#
# If not defined in the highest level the next level applies and so forth down
# the list. /etc/defaults and the environment variables declared in the
# Dockerfile(s) used to create this image are expected to define all
# environment variables used by scripts and Confd templates.
#
# Confd templates are required to use `getenv` function for all default values.

# Load the environment variables according to the expected precedence.
# Note `exec -c` is used to empty the existing environment.
#
# Write those to the container environment if not already present. The container
# environment has already been initialized by this point and contains levels 3 and
# 4 as mentioned in the top of this file.

# Temporary conditional to prevent issues with Kubernetes as `s6-envdir` expects the
# folder to contain only files, Kubernetes mounts a folder in this location and works
# with secrets in a different way. At a later time we'll revisit our convention to
# hopefully support all that Kuberentes has to offer while not degrading the
# quality of Swarm or Docker Compose. At the moment Kubernetes users will need
# to inject the secrets as environment variables. Please see
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-environment-variables
