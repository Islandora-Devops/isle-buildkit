to view the manager webapp on <http://localhost:80/manager/html/>.

```bash
docker run --rm -ti \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    islandora/tomcat

Additional users/groups/etc can be defined by adding more environment variables,
following the above conventions:

| Environment Variable        | Description                                |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| TOMCAT_USER_{USER}_NAME     | The user name                              |
| TOMCAT_USER_{USER}_PASSWORD | The password for the user                  |
| TOMCAT_USER_{USER}_ROLES    | Comma separated list of roles the user has |

> N.B. These do not have defaults.

For example to add a new user `someone` you would need to define the following:

| Environment Variable         | Value    |
| :--------------------------- | :------- |
| TOMCAT_USER_SOMEONE_NAME     | someone  |
| TOMCAT_USER_SOMEONE_PASSWORD | password |
| TOMCAT_USER_SOMEONE_ROLES    | admin    |

> N.B. For all of the settings above, images that descend from this image can
> apply a prefix to every setting. So for example `TOMCAT_CATALINA_OPTS` would
> become `FCREPO_TOMCAT_CATALINA_OPTS`. This is to allow for different settings
> on a per-service basis when sharing the same confd backend.
