## Updating

You can change the commit used for crayfish by modifying the build argument
`COMMIT` and `SHA256` in the `Dockerfile` shown as `XXXXXXXXXXXX` in the
following snippet:

```Dockerfile
ARG COMMIT=XXXXXXXXXXXX
#...
ARG SHA256=XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

You can generate the `SHA256` with the following commands:

```bash
COMMIT=$(cat crayfish/Dockerfile | grep -o 'COMMIT=.*' | cut -f2 -d=)
FILE=$(cat crayfish/Dockerfile | grep -o 'FILE=.*' | cut -f2 -d=)
URL=$(cat crayfish/Dockerfile | grep -o 'URL=.*' | cut -f2 -d=)
FILE=$(eval "echo $FILE")
URL=$(eval "echo $URL")
wget --quiet "${URL}"
shasum -a 256 "${FILE}" | cut -f1 -d' '
rm "${FILE}"
```

When changing the `COMMIT` and `SHA256` be sure to also update the composer lock files, this
can be done with the following commands:

```bash
make bake TARGET=crayfish

docker run --rm -ti \
  -v $(pwd)/crayfish/rootfs/var/www/crayfish/Recast/composer.lock:/var/www/crayfish/Recast/composer.lock \
