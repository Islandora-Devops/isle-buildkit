# Only applies to linux hosts, Docker Desktop comes bundled with Qemu.
# Allows us to build cross platform images by emulating the target platform.

# Additional repositories & tags to push to, in the format of
#
# repository:tag,repository:tag, etc
#
# This is in addition to the tag created by the build args above. So For
# example if you wanted to push the following tags to islandora:
#
# - islandora/drupal:9b9561027ac5fb513593329fc235f907eca0f528
# - islandora/drupal:3.2.1
# - islandora/drupal:3.2
# - islandora/drupal:3
# - islandora/drupal:latest
#
# You would set:
# buildkit.build-arg.repository=islandora
# buildkit.build-arg.tag=9b9561027ac5fb513593329fc235f907eca0f528

# Registry properties.
#
# It's important to note that weâ€™re using a domain containing a "." here, i.e.
# localhost.domain. If it were missing Docker would believe that localhost is a
# username, as in localhost/ubuntu. It would then try to push to the default
# Central Registry rather than our local repository. islandora.dev makes for a
# good default as we can generate certificates for it and avoid many problems.
# registry.domain=islandora.dev
# registry.port=443
# registry.bind.port=false
# The container should have the same name as the domain so that buildkit builder can find it by name.

# The repository path to use for all images when building, defaults to local.
# Override to push to your choosen remote repository.
docker.repository=local

# Tags to add to all images, can be overridden on a project by project basis.
# if unspecified latest is used.
docker.tags=latest

# The driver to use for the build, either "docker", "docker-container", or
# "kubernetes". Note that "docker" only supports "inline" cache mode and does
# *not* support multi-arch builds.
#
# Using 'docker-container' with a local repository requires that the following
# is set in your /etc/docker/daemon.json file.
# {
#  "insecure-registries" : ["http://isle-buildkit.registry"],
# }
docker.driver=docker

# Conditionally allows pushing when `docker.driver` is set to `docker`. If we
# are building with "docker-container" or "kubernetes" we must push as we need
# to be able to pull from from the registry when building downstream images.
docker.push=false

# Enable caching from/to remote/inline cache.
# These flags are forced to "false" if `docker.noCache` is set to "true".
# Defaults to the following depending on `docker.driver`:
docker.cacheFrom=true
docker.cacheTo=false

# The cache mode to use, either "max", "min", "inline".
# When `docker.driver` is set to "docker" only "inline" is valid.
# Defaults to the following depending on `docker.driver`:
#   - "docker" -> "inline"
#   - "docker-container" -> "max"
#   - "kubernetes" -> "max"
#
# docker.cacheToMode=

# The remote repository (v2) to use as a cache for images when building.
# Override to pull / push from your private remote repository cache.
#   - `docker.cacheFromRepositories` will default to `islandora` and the value of
#      the `docker.repository` property if set.
#   - `docker.cacheToRepositories` will default to the value of the `docker.repository`
#      property if set and "docker.cacheToMode" is set to "min" or "max".
#      it will use the tag ":cache" for storage.
# Both values are comma seperated lists.
#
#docker.cacheFromRepositories=
#docker.cacheToRepositories=

# The local/remote build cache can be disabled for debugging purposes.
# This disables `docker.cacheFrom` and `docker.cacheTo` as well as the
# local buildkit cache.
docker.noCache=false

# The platforms to build images for, If unspecified it will target the
# host platform. It is possible to target multiple platforms as builder
# will use emulation for architectures that do no match the host.
# Note this is not supported when `docker.driver` is set to "docker".
