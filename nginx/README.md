# Nginx

Docker image for [Nginx] version 1.16.1 and [FPM] version 7.3.17.

Please refer to the [Nginx Documentation] and [FPM Documentation] for more
in-depth information.

Acts as base Docker image for all PHP based services, such as Crayfish, Docker
etc. It can be used on it's own as well.

## Dependencies

Requires `islandora/base` docker image to build. Please refer to the
[Base Image README](../base/README.md) for additional information.

## Settings

> N.B. For all of the settings below images that descend from
> ``islandora/nginx`` will apply prefix to every setting. So for example
> `JWT_ADMIN_TOKEN` would become `GEMINI_JWT_ADMIN_TOKEN` this is to allow for
> different settings on a per-service basis.
