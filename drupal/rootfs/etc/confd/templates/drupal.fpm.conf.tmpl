# In Drupal 8, we must also match new paths where the '.php' appears in
# the middle, such as update.php/selection. The rule we use is strict,
# and only allows this pattern with the update.php front controller.
# This allows legacy path aliases in the form of
# blog/index.php/legacy-path to continue to route to Drupal nodes. If
# you do not have any paths like that, then you might prefer to use a
# laxer rule, such as:
#   location ~ \.php(/|$) {
# The laxer rule will continue to work if Drupal uses this new URL
# pattern with front controllers other than update.php in a future
# release.
