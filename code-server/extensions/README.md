# Extensions

[Code Server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) has its own marketplace for
extensions separate from Microsoft's due to Terms of Service. Sometimes
extensions we want to use are only available in Microsoft's marketplace in which
case we can download them and place them in this folder to get them installed.
This does not violate the TOS oddly enough though but installing directly
through Code Server does.
